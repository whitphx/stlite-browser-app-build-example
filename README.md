Example to install [`@stlite/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stlite/browser) as a dependency from NPM and build an app using it.
`@stlite/browser` needs to load the worker file and the `*.whl` files at runtime as external files, so some configurations are needed on the bundler that is Vite in this example.
